# Model Parameters
Above you will find model parameters for the different sample tests. All of these can be loaded using 'CAML_LOAD_SAV.py'. I was able to include an original test model which is titled 'model-92loglinear'.  

* Mini samples are labeled with 'sm' or 'xsm'
* 'Prolinear' indicates the ensemble consisted of a Probit and a Linear regression 
* 'Loglinear' indicates the ensemble consisted of a Logistic and a Linear regression
* Numbered models indicate the percent composition of negative-valued observations
