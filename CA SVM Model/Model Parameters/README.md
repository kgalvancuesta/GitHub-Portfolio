# Model Parameters
Above you will find model parameters for the different sample tests. All of these can be loaded using 'CAML_LOAD_SAV.py'. I was able to include an original test model which is titled 'model-92loglinear'. You will find mini samples as well labeled with 'sm' or 'xsm'. Prolinear indicates the ensemble consisted of a Probit and a Linear regression, while Log indicates a logistic regression. If a model is numbered, it indicates the percent composition of negative-valued observations.
