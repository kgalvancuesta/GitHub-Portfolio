# Results
Above you will find confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves for the different sample tests. While most are not the true tests, they illustrate the kinds of original tests that I ran. I was able to include the final SVM ROC curve which is titled 'Final Model SVM Ensemble'. You will find mini samples as well labeled with 'sm' or 'xsm'. Prolinear indicates the ensemble consisted of a Probit and a Linear regression, while Log indicates a logistic regression. If a set is numbered, it indicates the percent composition of negative-valued observations. Lastly, MET stands for Metrics, while ROC are saved ROC curves.
