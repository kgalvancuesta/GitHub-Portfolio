# Results
Above you will find confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves for the different sample tests. While most are not the original tests, they illustrate the kinds of tests that I ran. I was able to include the final SVM ROC curve which is titled 'Final Model SVM Ensemble'.

* Mini samples are labeled with 'sm' or 'xsm'
* 'Prolinear' indicates the ensemble consisted of a Probit and a Linear regression 
* 'Loglinear' indicates the ensemble consisted of a Logistic and a Linear regression
* Numbered models indicate the percent composition of negative-valued observations
* MET files are images of the output metrics
* ROC files are images of the output ROC curve
