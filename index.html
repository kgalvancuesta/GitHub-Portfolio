                    <p>This was the central project that I worked on as a consultant for the California Housing Department. 
                    Using our predicted financial metrics for building permits of different sizes, I created a Support Vector Machine ensemble to predict the likelihood a parcel of land would be developed.
                    A large portion of the preprocessing was completed in Stata using .do files. The regressions used as input for the SVM were also completed in Stata, but later migrated to Excel.
                    The SVM was made using Scikit-learn's SVM function in Python. Some final preprocessing occurs here as well as calculating and displaying metrics such as Precision, Recall, and ROC curves.
                    </p>
                    <p>Due to the size of the dataset, you will also find a GPU version of the Python file as we found ways to train the SVM more quickly. There are a variety of different tuning settings and training size sets
                    under the finalized models folder.</p>

                        On the left you are seeing our team's first iteration of a web app that allows you to analyze human poses without having to install any software tools on your device!

                        The desktop application, which is available for download, takes in images of a person and the subject’s height and outputs coordinates in a metric space using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from the BlazePose library.

                        Our website is based on the original app. It includes improved features and, most importantly, enhanced ability of mapping as many as 68 human body nodes and producing positional and angular data about their coordinates

                    <p>While working as the Advanced Econometrics teaching assistant, I wanted to bring more hands-on Machine Learning to the lecture series. I coded a problem set illustrating the probability mechanics
                       behind the Naive Bayes Algorithm, then removing sections and leaving instructions for the students to figure out.
                       Students were tasked will classifying a sample among different product types as the sample size increased.

                        Machine Learning Summer 2021
                        “Poisoning Attacks against SVMs” by Biggio (2013) We studied Gradient Ascent using various batch and step sizes. Our results were mixed but generally demonstrated quadratic patterns
                        of accuracy in different data sets.
                        “Efficient Label Contamination Attacks against Black-Box Learning” by Zhao (2017) Our
                        research delved into flip cost functions for potential attackers. We achieved 12 % reduction in
                        accuracy post-poisoning.

                        “Online Planning for Resource Production in RTS Games” by Ray (2007) Extended this
                        paper by modernizing its scheduling algorithms. Using the new approaches, efficiency of planning
                        increased by a few %.
                        “A Cascaded Supervised Learning Approach to Inverse RL” by Klein (2013) Researched alternative regressions in the estimation step. Due to the sparsity of our sample space, we selected
                        Gaussian Process and Ridge regressions which increased our R-Squared by 15 %.

                                I began by taking Algorithms, Data Structures, Linear Algebra, and other standard Computer Science courses. I finished my Computer Science degree specializing in Artificial Intelligence courses:
                                Sequential Decision Making, Machine Learning, Probability, Statistics, and Database courses. Here I worked on projects using SQL, HTML, Java, Python with its major libraries, and so on.
                                Some of these were graduate-level courses with substantial research components.

                                On the technical side, I took Statistics and Advanced Econometrics courses, as well as calculus-based Game Theory, and (Micro/Macro) Economic Theory.
                                My industry-specific courses included courses on Entrepreneurial Finance, Health Care, Labor Markets, Technology, and Public Finance.
                                I also participated as a TA in several courses in the department, but primarily for the Data Science courses Econometrics and its graduate-level counterpart, Advanced Econometrics.
                                My final essay in a supervised self-study Economic Philosophy course was selected as lecture material for Public Finance.

                                During my studies in Philosophy I specialized in Ethics with courses such as Ethics and Artificial Intelligence, Political and Social Philosophy, and Global Poverty.
                                I took a particular interest in Philosophy and the law with courses like Ethics and Public Policy, and Human Rights. This led me to take pre-law courses covering case law on individual rights and developments of the Constitution overtime.

                                I built a .NET image processor demo application to find key body points using Blazepose and OpenCV in Python.
                                As a result, the project received additional funding and I was given the opportunity to lead a new team to remodel the original work into web application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
                                Together we worked on testing and improving the robustness of the algorithm by 35 % for off-center and obscure image angles.
                                This project was commissioned for use by 80+ engineering schools in Africa and the U.S.

                                My primary responsibilities were to teach Data Analysis and Visualization through laboratory sections in R, Stata, and Python in addition to grading classwork.
                                I also hosted recitation sessions and office hours. A side role, which I thoroughly enjoyed, was creating new class material. My favorite material was adapting my machine learning work to create a new problem set for Advanced Econometrics.
