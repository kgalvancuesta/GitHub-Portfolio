                        This certification covered several topics including statistics, regressions, and machine learning techniques. As part of the program, I created a regression model for Automidata as
                        an imaginary workplace scenario. We were hired by the Taxi and Limousine Commission of New York City. The model used data from pick up and drop off locations, time stamps, fares, and other variables to predict trip durations. Furthermore, a decision
                        tree and XGBoost model were trained to predict whether a rider would be a generous tipper. These assisted the TLC in increasing revenue and improving ride efficiency, as well as providing drivers
                        ways to earn more revenue.

                        This certification delved deeply into project planning, data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, model construction with parameter tuning, visualizing results, and providing reports to
                        stakeholders. The GitHub repository contains executive summaries for each course within the program, along with Jupyter coding books to follow along with the work. Pickle files
                        are provided to run the models. The dataset can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neilclack/nyc-taxi-trip-data-google-public-data">here</a>.

                        This was the central project that I worked on as a consultant for the California Housing Department.
                        Using our predicted financial metrics for building permits of different sizes, I created a Support Vector Machine ensemble to predict the likelihood that a parcel of land would be developed.
                        A large portion of the preprocessing was completed in Stata using .do files. The regressions used as input for the SVM were also completed in Stata, but later migrated to Excel.
                        The SVM was made using Scikit-learn's SVM function in Python. Some final preprocessing occurs here as well as calculating and displaying metrics such as Precision, Recall, and ROC curves.

                    <p>
                        Due to the size of the original model parameters and datasets, I have only included the smallest files used for initial testing.
                        The finalized models folder contains various tuning settings and training size sets that were utilized to obtain the best-performing models.
                        Running the best models often took several days, and I have included the output of our final, highest-performing, Support Vector Machine model (pictured above).

                        Above you are seeing our team's first iteration of a web app that allows you to analyze human poses without having to install any software tools on your device!

                        The desktop application, which is available for download, takes in images of a person and the subject’s height and outputs coordinates in a metric space using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from the BlazePose and Caffe libraries.

                        Our website is based on the original app. It includes improved features and, most importantly, enhanced ability of mapping as many as 68 human body nodes and producing positional and angular data about their coordinates.

                    <p>
                        During my time as an Advanced Econometrics teaching assistant, I developed a hands-on approach to teaching Machine Learning concepts to students.
                        To achieve this, I created a problem set that demonstrated the probability mechanics behind the Naive Bayes Algorithm.
                        I removed certain sections from the assignment version and left instructions for the students to work out on their own.
                        The problem set involved creating synthetic samples, calculating the running sum of positive observations, and using those observations to calculate the chi-squared statistic.
                        The students were then tasked with predicting the likelihood of the next observation being positive.
                        Finally, I provided them with prior knowledge about the distribution of samples to train the classifier.
                        This approach helped to enhance the students' understanding of Machine Learning concepts and techniques.
                    </p>

                        Above is the probability estimate that Box 2 (b2) is of type X (chiX) as the number of observations increase. It is a multinomial classifier with 3 classifications.

                        While I also researched Online Planning, Cascaded Supervised Learning, and Inverse Reinforcement Learning, a highlight for me was an analysis of Battista Biggio's paper on "Poisoning Attacks against Support Vector Machines".
                        My focus was on Biggio's work in relation to poisoning attacks in adversarial environments, particularly his 2012 paper covering several kernel forms in Support Vector Machines.
                        I implemented the algorithm presented in the paper using Python and its Scikit-Learn and NumPy libraries.
                        Above is a graph of the SVM's classification on a noiseless, synthetic dataset post-poisoning (the SVM classifier had 100% accuracy before the applying the algorithm).
                        The labels x1 and x2 are arbitrary.
                        I also proposed and implemented a research extension by changing the order of the algorithm to maximize hinge loss by taking the negative gradient directly.

                                I began my studies by taking standard Computer Science courses, including Algorithms, Data Structures, and Linear Algebra. As I progressed, I specialized in Artificial Intelligence and completed courses in Sequential Decision Making, Machine Learning, Probability, Statistics, and Databases.
                                During my studies, I worked on several projects that involved working in SQL, HTML, Java, and Python with its major libraries. Some of these projects were part of graduate-level courses with substantial research components, allowing me to gain hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of the material.

I also completed several industry-specific courses, including Entrepreneurial Finance, Health Care, Labor Markets, Fintech, and Public Finance.

                                While I helped teach several courses, I primarily assisted the Data Science courses Econometrics and its graduate-level counterpart, Advanced Econometrics. As part of a supervised self-study course in Economic Philosophy, I wrote a final essay that was selected as lecture material for Public Finance.

                                In my studies of Philosophy, I focused on Ethics and completed several relevant courses, including Ethics and Artificial Intelligence, Political and Social Philosophy, and Global Poverty. Additionally, my interest in Philosophy and the law led me to enroll in courses such as Ethics and Public Policy and Human Rights.

                                I also explored pre-law courses that covered case law on individual rights and the development of the Constitution over time.

                                We devised a novel algorithm that leverages regression techniques to estimate the financial metrics of land parcels for development.
                                We utilized data on parcel attributes, including zoning borders and regulations, as well as environmental, demographic, and neighborhood variables.
                                Additionally, I developed multiple probabilistic learning approaches and an SVM ensemble using Python's Scikit-Learn library to predict the probability of obtaining building permits on land parcels. Lastly, I migrated the system to PyXLL to assist the State in making parcel distribution decisions.

                                A PhD Candidate and I built a .NET image processor demo application to find key body points using Blazepose and OpenCV in Python.
                                As a result, the project received additional funding and I was given the opportunity to lead a new team to remodel the original work into web application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
                                Together we worked on testing and improving the robustness of the algorithm by 35 % for off-center and obscure image angles.
                                Lastly, we increased the number of measured points and provided time-data about their position and angular relationships.
                                This project was commissioned for use by more than 80 engineering schools in Africa and the U.S.

                                As a teaching assistant, I was primarily responsible for teaching Data Analysis and Visualization through laboratory sections in R, Stata, and Python. Additionally, I graded classwork and hosted recitation sessions and office hours. I thoroughly enjoyed a side role of creating new class material, and my favorite project was adapting my machine learning work to create a new problem set for Advanced Econometrics. I created other various class materials such as homework and exam questions, as well as lecture materials.
